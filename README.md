# ADi-meals-mobile
A food web application that will serve the needs of users like Elon Musk, Baba Ijebu and co,
This Food order web app consist of two buttons that is shown to the user after a successful login. the button are "food box" and "soup box"
A food box consist of the major African meal such as: "ewa aganyin", "pound yam and egusi soup", and others while the Soup box consist of major Nigerian soup such as: "egusi soup", "efo riro", "ewedu soup", and others.
The Soup box category has three boxes a user can select food from, the boxes includes: mini, medium, and mega box.
Currently, I am still working on perfecting the authentication system, then afterward, I will move to the payment app to integrate payments system for my app.
I might add a chat box to the app later on, to help a user chat with the admin/staff directy
I hope you find my app journey interesting as you ride along with me.
Plus, I am actually creating this app for my Mum. She owns a small restaurant and I hope to surprise her with it by December!
That way her business can have a wider reach and audience.
